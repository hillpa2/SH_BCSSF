# SH_BCSSF
Samuel Hill Basic Cascading Style Sheet Framework

The test.html shows all/most of the features. The writen text in its divs shows the class names of the div or the parent div. Use test.html if you wish to learn how to use the framework. May provide better tutorial latter.

Objectives of SH_BCSSF:
1: create a small css framework small enough to be loaded near instantaneouss from any server to any user
2: make a framework that can do pretty much anything
3: create a framework comparable to Bootstrap

Requirements of SH_BCSSF:
1: be smaller than 4 killobytes
2: relative backwards capabilities with my previous html/css projects

Any CSS3 capable browser should be able to load properly everything in the framework. Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Midori, and IceCat have been tested and proven to work flawlessly as expected. 
Two non-CSS3 browsers have been tested and have rendered sufficiently and according to expectations. NetSurf (currently mostly a CSS2 browser) renders most elements properly however button's will not change with hovering/activation and the "neat" style will not have rounded edges. The Dillo Web Browser will for the most part only render the colors of the divs but renders eligibly.
